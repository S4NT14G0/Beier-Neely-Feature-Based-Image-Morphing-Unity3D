Feature-Based Image Metamorphis Unity-3D
Algorithm based off of Beier-Neely paper.

To Use:

Open Obama_Putin scene
Press Play

Modify:

If you would like to morph your own images you must mark the feature lines and add the points into A lines and B lines.  I did this using GIMP.
Warning: Unity Texture2D (0,0) starts at top left while most image editors start at (0,0).

TODO:

- Cleanup stray lines.
- Create editor script that allows line marking inside of unity.
- Create facial recognition algorithm to detect feature lines automatically.
- Fix animation code to animate morph over set of images.
